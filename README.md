Needs Maven to run, otherwise just look in the pom.xml what to download and copy paste the source files to a project.

# A tutorial to install Maven:
If you use Netbeans, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ODSQ0EpoQI?list=LLIf5VI5xhBnqfYTVi7Gz2cg">this</a> is all you need for instructions as Netbeans has a Maven plug-in standard.

# If you cannot BLAST:
- Open your cmd and see if you can use python there, use "python --version" or something like that.
- If that doesn't work, Python isn't correctly installed. In Windows you can manually add Python to your Path variables to fix it.

# Errors when running:
Errors get saved in a "ERRORS.txt" file in the working directory
